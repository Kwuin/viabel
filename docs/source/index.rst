VIABEL
======

VIABEL (**V**\ ariational **I**\ nference and **A**\ pproximation **B**\ ounds
that are **E**\ fficient and **L**\ ightweight) is a library (still in early
development) that provides two types of functionality:

#. A lightweight, flexible set of methods for variational inference that is agnostic to how the model is constructed. All that is required is a log density and its gradient.
#. Methods for computing bounds on the errors of the mean, standard deviation, and variance estimates produced by a continuous approximation to an (unnormalized) distribution. A canonical application is a variational approximation to a Bayesian posterior distribution.
